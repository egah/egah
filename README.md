### Who I am?
My name is Epiphane EGAH. I have a master's degree in econometry and statistics. During my studies, I have to perform a research project. I choose to work on word embedding. Since then, I have fallen in love with natural language processing.

Currently, I am learning :
- How to build artificial intelligence project with CRISP-DM
- Natural language processing 
- Computer vision 
- Machine learning operation (MLOps)
